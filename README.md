# Panelization-of-the-Buck-Converter-LM2596
This project is a DC-DC converter based on the LM2596 regulator, panelized for small-batch PCB production using KiCad and involving component selection, schematic creation, printed circuit board routing, and generation of manufacturing files. 
# Summary 
1. Creating my own libraries (schematics, footprints and adding a 3D model to each component).
2. Components placement.
3. Layer's stackup.
4. PCB Layout & Routing.
5. 3D model.
6. Gerber files, mechanical and assembly drawing.
